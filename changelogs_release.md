- Barrel Information is now shown on signs
- You can choose a speed in-game with */trigger speed*

## Changes:
- **New Lag reduction implemented to keep up with defense rotation**

## **Update 1.0.0 for ScrapTD3D released!**
-# Skipping Numbers is pretty much a trend now.

## New Defense:
- **Tesla Tower** <:D7:803725390106984508>
- **Gatling Gun II** <:D8:803725400974557194>

## New Features:
### - Multiplayer
### - Scrap
- **Health**
- A real spawnpoint

## Multiplayer:
### - Added a queue. 
- Once two or more players are in the queue, a countdown starts. You will get assigned one of two colors: Red/Blue
- If there are more than two people in queue, the game picks randomly between all queued players.
- In Multiplayer, you now have an Info Bar with information about **Scrap**,**Scrap per Second**,**Health** and your cooldown.
- The goal is to defeat your enemy.
- You can exit the game early by quitting the world.

## Scrap:
### - Added Scrap.
- You now require Scrap to purchase Barrels or Defense
- Scrap gets produced every 50gt (2.5s) *Note: This is slower than "per second", but this game runs at a reduced speed*
- Your Scrap Production increases with every spawned barrel / bought defense *Note: Increase is immediate. There is a bug that I will fix soon though*

## Changes and Bugfixes:
- **Changed ALL speeds to be slower to be more accurate with the original ScrapTD**

-# Note: There are sooooooooo many bugs that I unfortunately wasn't able to fix in time... I will be gone for a week and I want to release the update even if it could be better.

### Final Update Time!

## Update 1.0.1 for ScrapTD3D released!
-# This is so minor that there are probably still bugs.

### Changes and Bugfixes:
- **Updated to version 1.21.7 / 1.21.8**
- *Minor changes to some mechanics (unknown)*

Note: The game still contains bugs and limits, as it was never finished. It will no longer be receiving major updates and support for Legacy ScrapTD3D will end once I release the new game.
I have had fun while developing this game and hope that the legacy continues in the sequel.
